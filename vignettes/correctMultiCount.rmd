This package contains only one function *correctCounts* as to assign multiply-mapped-reads to the most abundant gene that it mapped to.

```{r warning=F}
library(correctMultiCount)

data(baseCount)
data(multiCount)

head(baseCount)
head(multiCount)
```

Noted that this function needed to two data frames with the exact column names as shown here.

* baseCount dataframe needed to have 2 columns named as 
  1. id 
  2. count
* multiCount dataframe needed to have 2 columns named as
  1. fragment_id         
  2. gene_id

``` {r}
df = correctCounts(baseCount,multiCount)
head(df)
```
