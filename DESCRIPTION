Maintainer: Douglas Wu <wckdouglas@gmail.com>
Description: This package aims to assign multiply mapped fragments from RNA-seq experiments
              to the most-abundantly-mapped gene. This require input of two files:
                1. base count file, which stores gene-id and gene-counts from uniquely-mapped-fragments
                2. multiply mapped read files, which store the fragment id, and the gene id that it mapped to
